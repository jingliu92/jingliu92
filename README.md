## Hi there 👋

I am a postdoctoral bioinformatician at the U.S. Dairy Forage Research Center, USDA-ARS. With 5+ years of experience in high-throughput data analysis, I specialize in interpreting complex biological data within human and animal genomics. 

My repositories here feature a variety of high-throughput sequencing data analysis pipelines, tools, and resources for results visualization.

I code in <img src="https://groverj3.github.io/images/Python-Logo.png" alt="Sample Image" width="60" height="20">, <img src="https://groverj3.github.io/images/Rlogo.png" alt="Sample Image" width="25" height="20">,<img src="https://groverj3.github.io/images/BASH_logo-transparent-bg-color.png" alt="Sample Image" width="25" height="20"> 

I speak 🐫 perl, ⚙️ rust, and 🐬 SQL
I pretend to speak 🙄 R and 🐍 Python.
😵 In my past lives, I used to code PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and even some C.
I have worked on some perl modules including Bio::Kmer but also more complete packages such as Mashtree and Lyve-SET. I have more in my repos and would be glad to collaborate with you!

 I code in Python, R Logo, R Logo, and anything else that piques my interest.

 I can manage a multi-user Linux  server environment and I live on the command line .

 I believe in open science, open source software, and reproducible data analysis.

 I've assembled transcriptomes, called genetic variants, annotated small RNA loci , and compared methylomes using sequencing data.

 I can create an analysis pipeline and deploy it on high performance computing clusters, cloud resources, or create visualizations and explore data in a Jupyter notebook.

 I'm a Ph.D. graduate of the Molecular and Cellular Biology Graduate Program at The University of Arizona. There, I worked in the Mosher Lab studying RNA-directed DNA methylation with next-generation sequencing techniques.

While you're here you can learn something about me or check out my blog where I post how-tos, thoughts on bioinformatics, and general nonsense.
