## Hi there 👋

I am a postdoctoral bioinformatician in US Dairy Forage Research Center at USDA-ARS. 
My repos include those for work and those for outside of work.

I speak 🐫 perl, ⚙️ rust, and 🐬 SQL
I pretend to speak 🙄 R and 🐍 Python.
😵 In my past lives, I used to code PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and even some C.
I have worked on some perl modules including Bio::Kmer but also more complete packages such as Mashtree and Lyve-SET. I have more in my repos and would be glad to collaborate with you!
